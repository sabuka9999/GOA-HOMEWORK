<h1>My Future Proffession: Sailor</h1>
<h2>To become s Sailor, I need to learn a lot about ships and sea.</h2>
<h2>As a sailor you need to work with a team. You need take care of the ship and make sure it stays safe and clean</h2>
<h2>Not everyone can stay 6-7 months in middle of the ocean. but most of the people can withstand these conditions.</h2>
<h2>as a sailor u can see beautiful sunsets over the sea and visit different countries.</h2>

<p>i am excited about my future as a Sailor and look forward to the adventures</p>
